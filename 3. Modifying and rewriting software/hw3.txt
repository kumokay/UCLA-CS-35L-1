1) 

Brady's patch essentially removes the line because 
there was the exact same expression right next to 
it. Thus he wanted to remove it in order to clean
up the code and avoid redundancy. 

2) 

The company would need to address the issue
of users in different countries where they would not 
understand English (The months are spelled in English). 
In addition the English date format is different from
how other countries post their dates. Thus if I'm 
running a company with people who are getting used 
to English, I would need to clarify what the date
is formmated like. 


3) 

If this invoked on an empty file, we will get an IndexError: 
list index out of range because the program has no lines for
the script to get. What the program
essentially does is  treat each line as items
for a list. But the problem occurs when try to access index [0] 
on something that is not there or is essentially empty

4) 

If the script runs Python 3 rather than Python 2, the error
I get is IOError as (errno, strerror): 
This happens because it has incorrect syntax and 
that according to StackOverFlow it says that it should be
changed to :
"except IOError as err;" 
Python 3 no longer allows what is
known as "iteration over exceptions unlike Python 2 which does
have it.
