I first get the coreutils tar file by using:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

I then unzip the tar file to get the coreutils
 content using the command I learned:

tar -xvzf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

I then make my own temporary directory using the command:
mkdir pene

I then see that there is also a coreutils-7.6 directory that I 
need to run the configure command with so I install it in the 
directory with the command. 

./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/michaelg/pene

I then make and make install to install coreutils 

make 
make install

I then change directories to ~/pene and see that there 
are three directories. We need to export the buggy
locale by doing this:

export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

This allows us to 
I then run the command that allows us to run the
coreutils ls command:

./ls -l 

which is installed in /usr/bin and see that it gets the date in 

YYYY-MM-DD format rather than traditional Unix date. 

To attempt to fix this, I go back to my coreutils-7.6 

I then go back and create the patch file by copying  
and pasting the diff part of Brady's email into a file with vim
then ran the patch with the command

path -p1 < patchfile

The -p1 enables me to take away the leading slash from the file. I 
then run the make command again within the 
coreutils-7.6 directory. We see that the commands are a lot shorter 
and many were actually unnecessary. The only thing it did was 
recompile the things that were changed. It also goes through the 
directories recursively but only changes the content in the
src folder and in the man folder.

I then make two test files and check whether the 
patch has been applied. The first one is a recently
created file and the second one will be one over a 
year old: 

touch recfile

and 

touch -t 1111111111 oldfile 

I then run both the buggy ls as well as the ls that
 has been patched and we 
get two different outputs. We see the buggy output
for bin/ls -l because we did not use 
make install and simply just used make. 

I used this for the buggy ls
../pene/bin/ls -l

and used this for the patched ls
./src/ls -l

This shows that we have both executables existing at
the same time while testing and did not
overwrite a buggy executable. 

Buggy: 

 2018-02-01 21:43 patchfile
2011-11-11 11:11 oldfile

Patched: 

Feb  1 21:43 patchfile
Nov 11  2011 oldfile

The output for the patched one appears to be in traditional Unix 
format. We see that the difference within the patched ls is that 
recently updated file shows the time last modified while the old 
file which is older than a year shows the year it was last modified. 

For the buggy ls it still has the YYYY-MM-DD format with the time
modified shown for both of them. The format is nearly identical.
