1. I used the 'man' command with a -k flag,
followed by the word that I need to be found. 

man -k printf
The command above prints out all the commands with the specific word 'printf'
In order to find this, I read the manual using man man. 

Keystrokes:
man man 
man -k printf

2. 
The cp program is located in /usr/bin/cp
The wc program is located in /usr/bin/wc

Keystrokes:
whereis cp 
whereis wc

3. /usr/bin/[ 
It is a shell builtin command and an executable for conditional tests. 

/usr/bin/w
Show's who is currently logged in and what they are doing. 

/usr/bin/X
This is a portable, network-transparent window system.

Keystrokes:
man find
find /usr/bin -executable -name '?' 

4. The actual file executed is: /usr/bin/emacs-24.3 
This is because /usr/bin/emacs is a soft
 link to /etc/alternatives/emacs, which is
also a soft link to /usr/bin/emacs-24.3. 

Keystrokes: 
cd /usr/bin
ls -l emacs*
cd /etc/alternatives
ls -l emacs*
cd /usr/bin
ls -l emacs*

5. The symbolic mode g+s,o-x means to set a group
 ID upon execution, while removing the permission to execute file for others. 

Keystrokes: 

man chmod 
chmod g+s,o-x hwahfile  

6. find -mtime -21 

The '-mtime' flag, followed by '-21'
lets me search for files that
were modified less than 21 * 24 hours ago. 

Keystrokes:
man find
find -mtime -21 

7. find -mtime -21 -type d

   Keystrokes:
   man find
   find -mtime -21 -type d

8. 293

Keystrokes:

whereis find
cd /usr/bin
find -type l | wc -l

9. Go into the /usr/lib directory 
and then use the ls -t and
ls -alt command to get the oldest folder to be -rwxr-xr-x 
1 root root   18692 Jan 26  2014 libgpg-error.so.0.10.0. 

So we can calculate this file to be 3 years 11 months and 352 days old.

Keystrokes:
cd /usr/lib 
ls -alt 

10.
The locale command gets the data based on the settings on
the environment variables that control the locale. I used
the command man locale in order to learn about this. 

11. 
Buffer-menu-sort
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields
tabulated-list-col-sort
tabulated-list-sort

Keystrokes: 
C-h a sort 

12. 

I start off every command with C-h k 

Then I type in the keystrokes I get these:

C-M-a beginning-of defun: Move back to beginning or preceding defun 

C-M-b backward-sexp: Move back over a  balanced expression 

C-M-c exit-recursive-edit: Exit from innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.

C-M-d down-list: Move forward one level of parentheses 

C-M-e end-of-defun: Move forward to end of the defun.  

C-M-f: forward-sexp: Move forward one balanced expression

C-M-h  Puts the mark at the end of this defun.
It puts the region around whole current or follwing defun.  


13. 
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.
It is used to clear the mini-buffer.  

Keystrokes:
C-h k C-g 

14. 
Yanking recovers the most recently killed text. 

Keystroke: C-h k C-g 

15.    
The difference is that the dired command will
show hidden files.
 In addition,
 The dired command allows you to interact
 and operate on files, delete files, etc.
 The list command simply lists the files and its information as an output. 

Keystroke: 
cd /usr/bin
ls -l
emacs C-x d /usr/bin
