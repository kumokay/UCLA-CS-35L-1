1.
emacs hw9.txt to create it.

2.

I then checkout a new branch
and name it quote

git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'

3.

I then install the patches onto the new branch using the command:

patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt


patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c


4.

I click the link to figure out how to use the emacs command:

C-x 4 a

5.

I then created the ChangeLog entry and pretty much copy for
all of the files. 


2018-03-12  Michael Kenneth Gee  <michaelg@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

        * util.c:  Grave accent converted to apostrophe in string constant.

        * sdiff.c: Grave accent converted to apostrophe in string constant.

        * dir.c: Grave accent converted to apostrophe in string constant.

        * diff3.c: Grave accent converted to apostrophe in string constant.

        * diff.c: Grave accent converted to apostrophe in string constant.

        * cmp.c: Grave accent converted to apostrophe in string constant.

6.

To commit changes to new branch I have to add it and then
proceed to commit it using the commands:

git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

I then check the message which says it now has the ChangeLog file.

7.

Using the command:

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt


8.

My partner is Angela Li.

We traded our patch files so I first create a new branch to check
out her code.

git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'

and then I add the patch from winscp and add her patch naming it

angela-formatted-patch.txt

Once I am in the directory, I use the patch.

git am angela-formatted-patch.txt

I edit the tests/Makefile.am and replace the line

; shell_or_perl_

to

;

I then run the command: 
chmod +x tests/binary tests/no-newline-at-eof


./bootstrap

I then apply the same patch that was provided
in step 13 of the assingnment and run the
commands:

./configure
make
make check

I then see that everything works.

To check whether the patch works I run both:

./src/diff . -
./src/diff --help

and both work, with only ' characters as opposed to the grave characters.

9.

I now heck that the ChangeLog worked for both me and  my partner

I run the command make distdir, which then creates a directory that
has my partner's patch. I then attempt to see my partner's changelog
and see that my partner's patch was successful.

10. 
The final step was to use gitk so I first ssh with the command here:

ssh -Y michaelg@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

I then go into the directory

cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs.

I then run the command

gitk

and 

find out that I get the result:

Merge branch 'master' into xwidget 2015-01-25 12:19:27

which seems that there is no newer merge here.
