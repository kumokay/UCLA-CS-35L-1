I first use the instructions on piazza to reset my
beaglebone. I follow this instructions and am able
to see that I reset it completely. I ran into a few
problems such as not being able to install
due to not disabling signature enforcements
and figuring out how to use the microSD adapter but
other than that I was able to follow the instructions
and get it to work. 

1. My partner: Angela Li

2/3. 

I first login to the UCLA_WEB wifi by using the steps
shown in piazza I first type in the host name 192.168.7.2
as the host and type in root as the username.

I then see that it asks for my password for which I then
I just press enter because the default password is empty.
I then issue the command
passwd
which then prompts me to enter my new password and
retype it to which I pick "root".

Enter new UNIX password:

Retype new UNIX password:

passwd: password updated successfully"

I then close my window and then proceed to do the
previous steps and am now prompted to give a password.

4.

I then use apt-get install update to
update the database of apt-get and

use the commands

sudo apt-get update

apt-get install xauth

and 

apt-get install xterm


5. 
I then use the command
sudo connmanctl

and logs me into this new interface.

I then proceed to use these instructions:

enable wifi

scan wifi

services

agent on

connect *UCLA_WEB long access point code*

quit

I am now logged on to the wifi which then

allows me to see my own hostname:

192.168.43.216

which is under the network interface "wlan0"
and labeled "inet addr" when I type in the command

ifconfig 
 
6.

I then proceed to follow the instructions that were
previously mentioned in #5 connecting the wi-fi
except I now connect to Angela's phone hotspot and
put in the password for the hotspot

enable wifi

scan wifi

services

agent on

connect *Angela's long access code for hotspot on phone*

Passphrase? 12345678

quit

7.

I then find her own hostname and ssh into
her board by

ssh root@192.168.43.192

I type in her password
12345678

and she logs into mine as well after I tell her
my password which is root.

8.
I then log out using
Control-D

I then create a non-root account for my partner
to log in. And I do this by adding
a username using

useradd michaelg

passwd michaelg

which proceeds to ask me for my password of which
I type in "wow" twice.


Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully

I then make a new directory mkdir and create
a directory:

mkdir /home/michaelg

and then I use the chown command to change the
owner of the file:

chown michaelg /home/michaelg

9.

I now use ssh to get into her newly created account.

ssh labPartner@192.168.43.192

and type in her password and I am able to access
her terminal using this command.

She also does the same thing to me.

10.

In order to login without a password I first use the command:

ssh-keygen

and then

ssh-copy-id labPartner@192.168.43.192

which allows me to proceed to being able to log in to her account
without using a password.

So I then I type in again:

ssh labPartner@192.168.43.192

and now I'm able to login without a password!

11.

I then first go into my beaglebone using the -X option:

ssh -X michaelg@192.168.43.216

and then I go into her beaglebone:

ssh -X labPartner@192.168.43.192

and then I type in the xterm command but I get an error that
says

xterm Xt error: Can't open display: 
xterm:  DISPLAY is not set

I then proceed to reboot the board after 'X11 Forwarding no'
is changed to yes and 'ForwardAgent yes' and 'ForwardX11 yes'
is contained within the file. I also install
'sudo apt-get install xvfb'. This allows me to run those commands
again which essentailly now works and I get to see the desired
shell window that displays on my host.
